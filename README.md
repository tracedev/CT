CT: Compressive Tracking
------------------------

Compressive Tracking is part of the [Visual Object Tracking Repository](https://github.com/gnebehay/VOTR), which aims at providing a central repository for state-of-the-art tracking algorithms that are freely available.

The source code for this tracker was obtained from its [project website](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/CT/CT.htm).

The following description was copied literally from the original author.

Note: the results shown by our paper is based on our MATLAB code. The results by this C++ code may be somewhat different from the results by our MATLAB code because there exist randomness in the code.
